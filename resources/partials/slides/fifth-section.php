    <p class="slided-out transition-transform" id="sec-5-par-1">Spikes are forbidden. Due to the close distance between them, players usually don't have enough time to react to fast balls.</p>
    <p class="slided-out transition-transform" id="sec-5-par-2">Slight feet movements are allowed, as long as the player doesn't completely move one of their feet out of its initial position (e.g. detaching it from the ground).</p>
    <p class="slided-out transition-transform" id="sec-5-par-3">Players can't hold the ball still.</p>
