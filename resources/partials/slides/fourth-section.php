    <p class="slided-out transition-transform" id="sec-4-par-1">Two main factors determine whether a throw is valid or not:</p>
    <p class="slided-out transition-transform" id="sec-4-par-2">If the ball hits the opponent on their pelvis or below, the throw is invalid.</p>
    <p class="slided-out transition-transform" id="sec-4-par-3">If the ball is thrown outside an imaginary circle around the opponent, where its radius is the opponent's arm length, the throw is invalid.</p>
